This repository is a library of examples/demo using Vagrant and vqfx10K. It also has the vagrant powerpoint slides  
Each example has its own directory and will contain at least a Vagrantfile

# Launch vqfx10k

**Once you have followed the [installation procedure](INSTALL.md), you can start topology with few lines**

To try an example, you just have to go inside a specific directory and run "vagrant up":
```
git clone https://git.juniper.net/vagrant/vqfx10k.git
cd vqfx10k-vagrant/light-2qfx
vagrant up
```
Once both VMs are up and running, you can connect to them with:
```
vagrant ssh vqfx1
vagrant ssh vqfx2
```

Available examples:
- [full-1qfx](full-1qfx)
- [full-1qfx-1srx](full-1qfx-1srv)
- [full-2qfx](full-2qfx)
- [light-1qfx](light-1qfx)
- [light-2qfx](light-2qfx)
- [light-2qfx-2srv](light-2qfx-2srv)

# vQFX10K

vqfx10k is a tool provided for lab and training; this is not a intended to be used in production.
Capacities are similar to a real QFX10K but performance are very limited in this version.

## Mode, Architecture and Limitations

vqfx10k for Vagrant can work in 2 modes: **Full** and **Light**

### Full Mode
In Full mode, it require 2 VMs for each instance:
 - 1 Routing Engine VM, running Junos (vqfx10k-re-virtualbox.box)
 - 1 Packet Forwarding Engine, running Linux (vqfx10k-pfe-virtualbox.box)

>In Full mode, the dataplane is fully functional and is very close to the real QFX10K

These 2 VMs need to be interconnected with a dedicated private network on their interface number 1, (interface 0 is always reserved for Vagrant for management).
All data plane interfaces need to be connected to the Routing Engine (RE) VM. Up to 12 data plane interfaces are supported.
Port names will be xe-0/0/0 to xe-0/0/11.

#### Full Mode Limitations
Only few features are not supported due to some architecture differences between vQFX10K and a real QFX10K

Unsupported features:
 - Analytics
 - Guest VM/ Guest container

### Light Mode

In Light mode, only 1 Routing Engine VM, running Junos is required for each instance

Up to 12 interfaces are supported to connect to external devices. Interface names will be em3 to em14

#### Light Mode Limitations
In Light mode, most data plane features are not supported and all packets are processed in kernel

- To be confirmed -
Family ethernet-switching is not supported

### VM Characteristics

#### vqfx10k-re

Requires:
- 1GB of memory
- Interfaces type must be type: 82540EM

A maximum of 15 interfaces are supported:
- first interface is used by vagrant (em0)
- second interface is used to connect to the PFE VM (em1)
- third interface is a management port not used (em2)
- All remaining interfaces can be used to connected to other devices

This VM has 2 account by default:
- login: vagrant, with ssh_key authentication using vagrant insecure_key
- login: root, password: Juniper

#### vqfx10k-pfe

Requires:
- 1.5GB of memory
- 1 dedicated core

A maximum of 2 interfaces are supported:
- first interface is used by vagrant (eth0)
- second interface is used to connect to the RE VM (eth1)

This VM has 2 account by default:
- login: vagrant, with ssh_key authentication using vagrant insecure_key
- login: root, password: no

# Vagrant

*What is Vagrant*
Vagrant is an open-source (MIT) tool for building and managing virtualized development environments developed by Mitchell Hashimoto and John Bender.
Vagrant is able to create VMs, connect them together and is specify configure them automatically.  
Here is a good [introduction to Vagrant for Network Engineer](https://www.dravetech.com/blog/2016/01/08/vagrant-for-network-engineers.html)

## Providers
For now, only VirtualBox is supported as a provider. VMware will be added soon.
